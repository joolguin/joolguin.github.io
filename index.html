                    Hello! I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you.
                    <br>
                    Diving into the pages of a good book is one of my favorite activities to relax and learn something new. But I don't just limit myself to reading; I also enjoy immersing myself in the world of cinema. Exploring different film genres and getting lost in captivating stories is one of the things I enjoy most in my free time.
                    
                    Music is another one of my passions. My favorite band, without a doubt, is Radiohead. The depth of their lyrics and the complexity of their music have always inspired and accompanied me in different moments of my life.
                    
                    But not everything is tranquility and contemplation. I'm also a sports enthusiast. Whether it's running on natural trails or playing tennis to keep the mind and body in balance.
                    
                    And then there's my big dream: to travel the world. I dream of exploring new places, immersing myself in different cultures, and meeting fascinating people. Each destination is an opportunity to learn something new and enrich my perspective of the world around us.
                    
                    As for my furry companions, I have an adorable dog named Nala. She's more than a pet; she's my loyal companion, who fills my life with joy and unconditional love.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Additionally, I have a passion for programming. You can check out my GitHub by clicking the button below.
